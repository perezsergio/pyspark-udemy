## What's new in spark 3?

Not many new features. 
Many deprecations: 
old rdd based ML lib deprecated in favor of df based ML library,
python2 deprecated,

Hype around spark3 including deep learning libs, but it didn't happen.
Some features were introduced to use spark together with some deep learning
frameworks like tensor flow.

The main improvement of spark3 is that it is much faster.
It is much faster that spark2.
This happens behind the scenes,
so its not really something you can notice when writing code.
